### Introduction 
The web final project is intended for student organization CMU Summit on US-CHINA Innovation and Entrepreneruship conference. 
The project has the ability to allow users to register for events, look up location of the conference. In addition, it is dynamic
in term of graphical design. The project will offically launch on 01.01.2017. 



1. Problem Description

The problem is that the old CMU Summit conference website had not interactive or dynamic features. Therefore, my task was to improve
and implement a new web app. 

2. Approaches Taken
  1. Using and building more dynamic features such as the animation for agenda. 
  2. Using as much embedded features as possible to ensure optimal efficiency for the website. e.g. embedded Google map, youtube video
  3. change head icon into circular framework to display speaker info. 
  
3. For the rest of the report, we will have
  1. features of the product design
  2. features developed
  3. assessment
  4. appendix 
  
### Feature of the product design 

For the product design, the web application focuses on using as much dynamic features as possible. Things like animation for windows
appearing in the agenda section are great examples of the intended design. 

### Features development

Built google form and embedded into the website. The choice of using an external service is to ensure students in the future can
have assess to the data stored there. The same reasoning goes for the embedded google map to show where the event is holding. 

### Assessment 

The final project does fix the lack of dynamic features and include more user friendly data collecting mechanism. In addition, having 
an external database (maximum 40,000 rows for Google spreadsheet) allow students in charge of web maintaince be able to easily 
access the content. 

### Appendix 

Using Bootstrap minimal style and basic front end template for the website building. The detail can be found in the comments of
my codes.
